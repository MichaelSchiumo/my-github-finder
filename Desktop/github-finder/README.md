Welcome to GithubFinder! This project was built using React and React Context, and is a simple way to search Github users from the Github API, and view information about specific users, as well as visit links to the profiles hosted on Github's site.

To start, simply run 'npm start.'

Type in a username for a Github user, and click search. Find the right user, click the 'More' button, and you will see a list of repos, followers, and other personal information from that user's profile, as well as a link to the Github page for that user.

This application is live at https://msgithubfinder.netlify.app

This application was built using a template from Brad Traversy.
